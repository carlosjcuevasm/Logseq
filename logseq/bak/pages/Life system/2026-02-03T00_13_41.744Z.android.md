- Got it. Ultra-simple, no extra structure.
  Here’s a **clean, concise summary of what *you* said**, nothing added.
  
  ---
- ### Core idea
  
  Everything that can be acknowledged as “something” is a **node**.
  
  Topics, projects, interests, needs, goals, habits — all are nodes.
  There is no real difference between them.
  
  ---
- ### Nodes & relationships
- Nodes can relate to **multiple other nodes**
- There is **no single hierarchy**
- Grouping is contextual, not absolute
  
  A node like *hydroponics* can relate to:
- Food
- Home décor
- Recovery
  Each with different **degrees of relevance**
  
  ---
- ### Weights instead of categories
  
  Relationships between nodes can be **weighted**:
- 0 → no relation
- 0.5 → some relation
- 1 → helps
- 1.5 → strongly helps
- 2 → belongs
  
  This avoids forcing things into one box.
  
  ---
- ### Human needs as core nodes
  
  At minimum, human life stabilizes around **three domains**:
- **Provision** – material viability, continuity, external value
- **Expression** – identity, agency, meaning, interest
- **Recovery** – health, energy, nervous system sustainability
  
  Everything touches all three to some degree.
  
  ---
- ### Meaning
  
  Meaning comes from **knowing why a node exists in your life**.
  Humans feel better when effort clearly matters.
  
  Reframing necessary things positively is **correct framing**, not self-deception.
  
  ---
- ### Modes
  
  Any node can be in one of two modes:
- **Build** – effortful, draining, capacity-creating
- **Sustain** – stable, often restoring
  
  Imbalance is normal short-term. Stability matters long-term.
  
  ---
- ### Energy over time
  
  Life is not time management but **energy management**.
  Some nodes drain energy, others restore it.
  
  Expression:
- drains when beginner or evaluative
- restores when fluent
- drains again under pressure
  
  ---
- ### No false distinctions
  
  Topics, projects, interests, goals — these are **states of nodes**, not different kinds of things.
  
  All nodes are **actionable**, at least potentially.
  
  ---
  
  That’s the model.
  No optimization. No moral scoring. Just clarity.
