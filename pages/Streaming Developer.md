- You’re noticing something important.
- the modern pillar model looks like:
	- Frontend
	- Backend
	- **Time-based systems (streams, events, schedulers)**
- Engineers who can reason across **all three** are rare — and that’s where senior pay bands live.
- A clean way to think about **modern “business software” engineering** today is this:
	- **Front end** → how humans interact with the system
	- **Back end** → rules, orchestration, persistence, APIs
	- **Data streams** → how the system reacts _over time_ and _at scale_
- That third pillar didn’t used to be explicit. Now it is.
- A clearer framing:
	- **Frontend**
		- UI, UX, dashboards, internal tools
		- Optimized for **latency, clarity, and usability**
	- **Backend**
		- Business logic, workflows, permissions, databases
		- Optimized for **correctness, consistency, and change**
	- **Data streaming / event systems**
		- Kafka, Kinesis, Flink, queues, schedulers, real-time pipelines
		- Optimized for **time, flow, state, and resilience**
- Why this matters:
	- Companies don’t just _store_ data anymore — they **react to it**
	- Ads, recommendations, fraud, analytics, personalization, automation
	- That reaction happens through **streams**, not request/response APIs
- This is why:
	- “Streaming” roles pay more
	- “Real-time” shows up in job descriptions everywhere
	- Systems thinking > CRUD thinking
- And here’s the key insight for _you_:
- You already operate in the **third pillar**.
-
- **Short, clear summary**
	- “Streaming” job titles often mean **data streaming** (Kafka, Kinesis, Flink), not **media streaming** (HLS, FAST, SSAI)
	- These roles pay well because real-time data pipelines are critical for **AI, ads, analytics, and connected devices**
	- You don’t currently have direct Kafka-style experience, so a full pivot now would reset seniority
	- Your skills are **adjacent** (real-time systems, state, timing, reliability), not unrelated
	- Best move: **don’t pivot hard** — gradually add data-streaming skills on top of your media streaming profile
	- This lets you target higher-paying **media + real-time data** roles without starting over
	- If you want, I can map your FAST / Channel Engine experience directly to Kafka concepts in one page
	  ---
- **Concise summary, mapped to your work**
	- **Streams vs events**
		- You already handle continuous playback streams made of discrete events (segments, manifest updates)
	- **Time windows**
		- You work with start/end times, wall-clock scheduling, and dynamic window extension (JIT mode)
	- **Stateful systems**
		- You manage live state (current event, override vs schedule, in-memory vs persisted state)
	- **Backpressure thinking**
		- You design fallbacks (asset manager, slate) to handle gaps or missing inputs
	- **Real-time reliability**
		- Your systems must always output something and switch immediately without blocking
	- **Producer / consumer model**
		- Schedulers and APIs produce decisions; Channel Engine and players consume them
		  
		  ---
- **Bottom line**
	- You already have the *streaming systems mindset* — applied to media instead of Kafka-style data streams
