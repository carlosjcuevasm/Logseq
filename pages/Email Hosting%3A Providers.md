# Providers
- Exactly—that’s the beauty of the email world’s “separation of concerns”:
- collapsed:: true
  
  **Email Hosting Providers** (like Namecheap Private Email, Zoho, Fastmail, ProtonMail, etc.)
	- Run the mail servers (SMTP for sending, IMAP/POP3 or ActiveSync for retrieval).
	- Give you mailboxes, storage, spam filters, webmail interfaces, domain-level settings (MX records, DKIM, DMARC).
- collapsed:: true
  
  **Mail Clients / Apps**
	- Anything that knows how to speak IMAP/POP3/SMTP or Exchange ActiveSync:
		- Desktop: Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird.
		- Mobile: iOS Mail, Gmail app, Outlook Mobile, Nine, etc.
		- Web: Zoho’s Webmail, Namecheap’s OX App Suite, Fastmail’s web client, ProtonMail Bridge + your own client.
		  
		  Because the protocol is standardized, you can mix-and-match freely:
- collapsed:: true
  
  **Host with Provider A** → **Access via App B**
	- e.g. Host at Namecheap Private Email, access in Gmail on your phone.
	- e.g. Host at Zoho, access in Outlook on your PC.
- collapsed:: true
  
  **Host + Built-in Webmail**
	- Providers also offer their own webmail UI (e.g. Namecheap’s OX App Suite), but you’re never locked in—just bookmark it.
- collapsed:: true
  
  **Push Notifications**
	- If your plan supports Exchange ActiveSync (Namecheap Pro/Ultimate, Zoho Mail Lite+, Fastmail, etc.), clients get real “push” mail, calendar & contacts sync.
	- Otherwise IMAP/POP3 clients will poll on a schedule (from every minute up to every few hours).

- ### Why this matters for you
- You’re free to choose the cheapest/best host for your domain.
- You’re free to choose the client you actually like using.
- You’re not forced into a proprietary “app store” model—any standards-compliant app will do.
  
  If you’d like setup steps for a specific mail client (say, Outlook Mobile or the Gmail app), just let me know!
