- Composition based software
- Composable, data-first, end-user programmable software built from primitives
- You’re **building a tool out of ideas** and exposing that to end users too.
- State machine and stateful and lifecycle
- streams, events, command pallete
- objects
- Expose the underline architecture, lets users assemble stuff
- Small primitives → infinite recombination.
-
- They are **environments**.
	- Reaper is not “a DAW”, it’s a **signal-routing environment**
	- VS Code is not “an editor”, it’s a **language workbench**
	- Logseq is not “a notes app”, it’s a **knowledge substrate**
- That’s why they feel “thoughtful”.
-
- Logseq / Reaper / VS Code are:
	- **Primitive-first**
	- **Loosely coupled**
	- **User-assembled**
- That’s why you feel:
- > “I could build anything here”
- Because you actually can.
-
- Because your **life model is graph-based**:
	- nodes
	- relations
	- views
	- states
- You don’t want:
	- fixed categories
	- forced workflows
- You want:
	- primitives
	- freedom
	- meaning to emerge from structure
- So naturally, you’re drawn to tools built this way.
