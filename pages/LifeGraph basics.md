- **Recapping the System Summary**
-
- Core of the system:
	- **Freedom of capture**: No hierarchy forced—you drop nodes anywhere (Inbox, Journal) then wire up your DAG on your own terms.
	- **True ownership & portability**: Your entire GrafoVida lives in files you control—no vendor lock-in.
	- **Evolving nodes**: Any tag or task can grow into a full node/page when you’re ready, and your graph adapts organically.
	  In short, GrafoVida rides the second-wave ethos: local-first, graph-driven, block-granular capture → act → organize—exactly the model you’ve outlined
-
- You're designing a flexible, free-form graph where **everything is a node**. Relationships and connections within your system are adaptable, which makes it highly customizable.
  
  **Part 1: System Summary**
- ### Nodes & Relations
- Everything is a node, with dynamic relationships.
- ### Workflow Patterns
- Action-First / Triage-Later and Triage-First / Action-Later.
- ### Properties as Emergent Nodes
- Properties evolve, becoming central nodes.
- ### Dual Layers
- Action Layer and Knowledge Layer.
- ### Why a DAG Fits
- A Directed Acyclic Graph structure fits to manage priorities, knowledge, and actionable tasks.
  
  **Part 2: How Logseq Supports Your System**
- ### Capturing Nodes Anytime
- Flexibly add information anytime.
- ### Acting & Tracking Tasks
- Capture actions as tasks, connected to relevant data.
- ### Organizing & Visualizing the Graph
- Use nested structure and backlinks for better organization.
- ### Portability & Flexibility
- Stay adaptable with portable knowledge storage.
  
  Thought for 10 seconds
  
  **Part 1: Your System Summary**
  
  **Nodes & Relations**
- **Everything is a node**: projects, categories, tasks, notes —even simple properties like “tasty.”
- **Relations** are edges you draw between nodes; there’s no forced parent/child hierarchy.
  
  **Workflow Modes**
- **Action-First → Triage-Later**: Dump raw tasks and ideas into an inbox, execute what you can, then sort & link later.
- **Triage-First → Action-Later**: Review and organize your backlog before diving into execution.
  
  **Deferred Enrichment**
- **Capture now, structure later**: Write down tasks and thoughts without metadata; during a review session add links, tags, or promote to full nodes when deeper documentation is needed.
  
  **Properties as Emergent Nodes**
- Turn any tag or attribute (e.g. `#tasty`) into its own node when you want to flesh out that concept and link all related items.
  
  **Dual Layers**
- **Action Layer** – your task-nodes and project-nodes that drive real-time progress.
- **Knowledge Layer** – your note-nodes, resources, and rationale that you build out when you have bandwidth.
  
  **Why a DAG?**
- Freely floating nodes and multi-directional links let you model complex, evolving relationships without rigid structure.

  **Part 2: Why Logseq Works & How It Fits**
- ### 1. Freely Capture Nodes
- **Daily Journal / Inbox** pages are always available for zero-friction dumping of tasks, ideas, or notes as individual blocks (micro-nodes).
- ### 2. Interactive Action Layer
- **Task statuses** (`TODO`/`DOING`/`DONE`) turn blocks into actionable items.
- **Built-in Task Overview** (`/task overview`) or `{{query (task TODO)}}` instantly surfaces every open task across your graph.
- **Inline child blocks** let you nest immediate steps or quick notes under a task-node.
- ### 3. Flexible Organization
- **Bi-directional `[[links]]`** create edges; the backlinks panel shows every reference so nodes stay connected.
- **Map-of-Content (MOC) pages** serve as manual indexes pointing at related nodes in the DAG.
- **Graph View** visualizes your entire network of nodes and relations, highlighting clusters and orphans.
- ### 4. Deferred Enrichment & Promotion
- **Block-to-Page promotion** (via plugin or core feature) lets you spin any task or note block into its own page-node when it needs full-blown documentation.
- **Upgrading tags** is as easy as creating a `[[Tag Name]]` page and linking existing nodes to it.
- ### 5. Portability & Transparency
- All your data lives as **plain-text Markdown/Org files** in a folder you control. You can version-control, archive, or migrate your entire DAG without lock-in.
  
  Logseq’s block-and-page model, queryable DAG, visual graph, and plain-text portability align perfectly with your Capture → Act → Organize system—giving you the freedom to dump, do, and defer structure exactly as your workflow demands.
