- [[Nodes tools]]
-
-
- ***Define your thinking, then map tools to it*** (You're lucky)
  collapsed:: true
	- Usualmente es dificil porque las herramientas vienen dadas con tus decisiones... tuve suerte con la era PKM
	- People usually: pick a tool, inherit a workflow, fight it quietly....
	- Yo
		- defined meaning
		- derived structure
		- evaluated tools honestly
		- stopped when friction outweighed value
		- **That’s mature systems thinking.** + algo de tiempo.... (2 weeks)
	- Whether you stay with Logseq for everything, or offload execution to a kanban app later—you didn’t waste time. You built something **you understand**.
-
- Me di cuenta que, necesitas un [Life model]([[Life System]]) (**las unidades**) y un [Control system]([[Nodes tools]]) (**como progresarlas**)
- Model + Control System

- ### Core idea
  
  Everything that can be acknowledged as “something” is a **node**.
  
  Topics, projects, interests, needs, goals, habits — all are nodes.
  There is no real difference between them.
-
- Node as objects as in programing. You can have **types** of nodes, thus **classes**.
  collapsed:: true
	- Nodes can have **properties** or **attributes** etc (these also nodes if necessary) . This helps define the intended usage of the node
	- Thus, with this possibility, the feature of **work items, topics, classification** etc, based on the types of prop they own.
	- Some types of nodes
		- Work items
			- Actionable items use to advance the richness of any topic node. Used on kanban etcc with props like etc
		- Work pack items
		  collapsed:: true
			- a node that _owns_ work items (or other epics). with props like etc...
			- to avoid agreggating and calculations etc you reference for work items
			- pic: [[Audio Modular Library]] (P3)
			  Item Priority: 2
			  This means:
			- Epic sets contextual importance
			- Item has local urgency
			- Final judgment happens in your head
			- That’s not a flaw — that’s appropriate for a human system.

- ### Nodes & relationships
- Nodes can relate to **multiple other nodes**
- There is **no single hierarchy**
- Grouping is contextual, not absolute
  
  A node like *hydroponics* can relate to:
- Food
- Home décor
- Recovery
  Each with different **degrees of relevance**
-
-
- ---
- ### Weights instead of categories
  
  Relationships between nodes can be **weighted**:
- 0 → no relation
- 0.5 → some relation
- 1 → helps
- 1.5 → strongly helps
- 2 → belongs
  
  This avoids forcing things into one box.

- ### Human needs as core nodes
  
  At minimum, human life stabilizes around **three domains**:
- **Provision** – material viability, continuity, external value
- **Expression** – identity, agency, meaning, interest
- **Recovery** – health, energy, nervous system sustainability
  
  Everything touches all three to some degree.
-
- . Leaving Provision / Expression / Recovery implicit
  
  Good call.
  
  Not every node needs visible domain metadata
  
  Domains are interpretive lenses, not mandatory fields
  
  Show them only when they help decisions (work items, projects)
- this keep metadata meaningufl when present
- in essence for provision
-
- **0** → no provision value
- **0.5** → possible, not pursued
- **1** → viable, maybe later on your terms
- **>1** → deliberate provision intent
-
-
- ---
- ### Meaning
  
  Meaning comes from **knowing why a node exists in your life**.
  Humans feel better when effort clearly matters.
  
  Reframing necessary things positively is **correct framing**, not self-deception.
  
  ---
- ### Modes
  
  Any node can be in one of two modes:
- **Build** – effortful, draining, capacity-creating
- **Sustain** – stable, often restoring
  
  Imbalance is normal short-term. Stability matters long-term.
  
  ---
- ### Energy over time
  
  Life is not time management but **energy management**.
  Some nodes drain energy, others restore it.
  
  Expression:
- drains when beginner or evaluative
- restores when fluent
- drains again under pressure
  
  ---
- ### No false distinctions
  
  Topics, projects, interests, goals — these are **states of nodes**, not different kinds of things.
  
  All nodes are **actionable**, at least potentially.
  
  ---
  
  That’s the model.
  No optimization. No moral scoring. Just clarity.
